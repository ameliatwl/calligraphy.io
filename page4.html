    <h1>Meetup with fellow enthusiasts</h1>
    <h2>Art Expressions</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">This is a newly formed group by a group of 39 Singaporeans who love to handletter, sketch and watercolour! Every month they will have an art session together, where a few of them will take turns to share some basics on handlettering/sketching/watercolouring, and they will have time to practice and learn from one another. They are all not professionals, and each of them are still learning and discovering as well, so no pressure at all! At this meetup, they will have conversations, time to letter, sketch, doodle, watercolour! Materials will be provided, but if you like to bring your own, feel free!
