    <h1>Tools needed</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
        Before sitting down to learn how to create modern calligraphy, you need a few tools:
    </p>


     <h2>1. Paper</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px"> While you can use nearly any type of paper for modern calligraphy, high quality paper can extend the life of your pens and brushes. Laser jet paper will provide a smooth surface for your lettering, while inkjet paper contains tiny fibers that, over time, can snag and fray your pen tips. You may also choose a pad of paper that comes pre-printed with dots, lines or grids, which can provide a reference guide for how to place and align your letters. (Or, of course, you can print your own guidelines onto the laser jet paper if you have a printer at home.) </p>


    <h2>2. Pens</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px"> There are a wide variety of pens that you can use for modern calligraphy, based on your personal preferences and style. Pens vary based on their tip size and tip flexibility. Pens with a longer tip and more flexibility will be more suited for larger writing, while a smaller tip will allow you to create smaller, more precise letters. </p>

    <h2>3. Pencils</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px"> While you won’t use a pencil very often when you’re learning the basics of forming letters, it may be helpful for later projects. When adding modern calligraphy to an envelope, for example, you may want to sketch out the placement of the writing before you begin, so you can ensure that the name and address is centered. Once you’ve written the words with your pen, you can erase the pencil lines with a kneaded eraser. </p>

    <h2>4. Ruler</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px"> Along with pencils, a ruler can help you add some guidelines to your paper, envelope, or other medium before you begin lettering. Even if you’re practicing a more freeform style of modern calligraphy, such as bounce lettering, you’ll want to have an established, straight baseline to work from, especially as a beginner.  </p>
